<!-- **API Versioning**
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 12.0.2
Install NuGet package manager from extensions
Open Command Palette ">nuget"
select Nuget Package Manager: Add Package
add "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning"
select version 4.0.0
run dotnet restore.


Versioning: for the time being, this is our solve to use api v2.0. Add `o.DefaultApiVersion = new ApiVersion(2, 0);});` to our api Startup.cs under the `ConfigureServices` section. Not sure why this isn't workin in the ApiHelper class in client project.

Adding Swagger:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio-code

-`dotnet add ProjectNameApi.csproj package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore -v 5.5.0`
to the ConfigureServices section, add:
-add `services.AddDbContext<TodoContext>(opt =>
        opt.UseInMemoryDatabase("TodoList"));`
-add `services.AddSwaggerGen();`

services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_1); USE THIS ONE
 Below version is already in our code. Use the above or edit to change version to 2_2
  // services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

to the Configure section, add middleware:
-`app.UseSwagger();`
-`app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
  {
      c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
  });`
